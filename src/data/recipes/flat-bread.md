# Flat Bread

I use this bread as either a base or a side for most of the dishes on this site.  I'm a creature of 
habit, so I don't vary it much, but I'm sure you could add herbs or other accoutrements to make it 
your own.

# Ingredients

* 1 cup flour (I use a mix of unbleached white and keto, but white is fine)
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1 tsp baking powder
* 1 tsp olive oil
* 1/3 cup water (approximately)

# Directions

I like using a mini food chopper to make the dough.  You can rough it if you want, but why?

1. Add the flour, salt, baking powder, and olive oil to the food chopper.
2. Pulse until the mixture is blended.
3. Slowly add the water until the dough begins to form.  Ultimately, the dough should be one 
    large ball with possibly a few smaller stragglers.  Opt for less water and add slowly.
    The dough should be slightly sticky when you touch it.
4. Put the dough in a small bowl and cover.  Let it rest for 30 minutes.  The dough won't rise, 
    but giving it time to rest allows the ingredients to further combine.  You can skip this step
    if necessary.
