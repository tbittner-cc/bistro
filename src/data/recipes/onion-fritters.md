This is a good low carb alternative for onion rings.  Add a tsp of turmeric or curry powder and
it becomes vegetable pakora.  

# Ingredients

* 1 large onion sliced thin (~1/4 inch slices or thinner)
* 1/2 cup chickpea flour
* 1 tsp salt divided
* 1/4 cup water 

# Directions

1. Mix the flour, 1/2 tsp salt, and water in a small bowl.  The consistency shouldn't quite be a paste,
but nor should it be runny.
2. Add the onions and combine until evenly coated.
3. Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F.
4. Spray the air fryer with air fryer friendly baking spray.
5. Place the fritters in the air fryer basket, coat with spray, and cook for 15 minutes, flipping once.
6. Remove from the air fryer, sprinkle with the reserved salt, and serve.
