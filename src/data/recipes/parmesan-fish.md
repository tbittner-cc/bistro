This is an easy weeknight dinner that pairs well with a lot of different sides.

# Ingredients

* 2 cod fillets
* 2 tbsp mayonnaise
* 1/2 tsp garlic powder
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/4 tsp pepper
* 1/4 cup parmesan cheese, grated
* Additional salt and pepper for seasoning

# Directions

1. Preheat air fryer to 400 degrees F.
2. Mix all the ingredients (except the fish) in a small bowl.
3. Spray the air fryer with air fryer friendly baking spray.
4. Season one side of the fish with salt and pepper.  Do not coat with mayo mixture yet.
5. Place the fish in the air fryer and fry for 8 minutes.
6. Flip the fish, season with the mixture and cook an additional 4 minutes.

Your cooking time may vary slightly depending on the thickness of the fillets.  The fish 
is done when it flakes easily with a fork.  Otherwise, it still might bight you like
