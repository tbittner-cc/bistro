Though no one will ever confuse this with a stick to your ribs, honest-to-god Texas cattle burger, it's a great 
addition to your repertoire on those nights you don't want to eat red meat just to prove a political point.  I'm 
actually vastly underselling this burger.  Don't be afraid to try vegetables kids!

# Ingredients
* 1 cup canned black beans
* 1/2 cup flour
* 1 tsp Worchestershire sauce
* 1 tbsp Frank's Red Hot Sauce
* 1/2 tsp garlic powder
* 1/2 tsp cumin
* 1/2 tsp onion powder
* 1/2 tsp paprika
* 1 tsp chili powder
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1 tbsp olive oil

# Directions
1. Drain and mash the beans with a potato masher (preferred), a fork, or some other preferred mashing instrument.
2. Combine all ingredients in a medium bowl.  The mixture will be sticky to the touch, much like wet dough.  If it's 
drier, that's fine, but make sure it binds together well.
4. Add olive oil to a pan and preheat over medium-high heat. 
5. Roll the black bean mixture into a ball and place in the pan.
6. Cook two minutes until a crust forms.  Flip and flatten.  Cook for another two minutes.
7. Flip again and cook an additional 2-3 minutes.  Finally, flip once more and cook for another 2-3 minutes.
8. Remove from heat and serve.

If your adding cheese, add it just after the final flip and cover the pan to ensure the cheese melts properly.
