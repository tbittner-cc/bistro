# Pasta with Shrimp and Lemon Cream Sauce

It's all in the roux!  Don't you hate it when people say that?  It's like droning on and on about
an unoaked Chardonnay.  Roux is actually very simple and it helps maintain the structure of the 
sauce while you bomb it with lemon.

# Ingredients
* 4 oz pasta (preferrably a long noodle like spaghetti)
* 8 oz shrimp
* 1 lemon, quartered
* 1 1/2 tbsp unsalted butter
* 1 tsp salt, divided (plus more for boiling the pasta) 
* 1/4 cup parmesan cheese (plus more for topping the dish)
* 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper, divided
* 1/4 cream or half-and-half
* 1 tbsp olive oil
* 1/2 tsp pepper, divided
* 1/4 tsp garlic powder
* 1 1/2 tbsp flour
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1/2 tsp dried Italian seasoning

# Directions

## Make the sauce
1. Add butter and 1/2 tsp salt to a small pot over medium heat.
2. When the butter melts, add the flour and combine until thick.  This shouldn't take more than a minute.
3. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.
4. Add the cream, 1/4 tsp red pepper, 1/4 tsp pepper, and Italian seasoning and lower the heat to the lowest setting.

7. Using a fine grater, add 1/2 tsp of lemon zest to the sauce.
8. Add the parmesan and stir until melted.  If necessary, increase the heat slightly.
9. The sauce should have the consistency of a a cream soup.  If it's too thick, trickle in water until 
    you reach your desired consistency.
10. Turn back down to the lowest setting.  Stir occasionally while preparing the rest of the dish.
